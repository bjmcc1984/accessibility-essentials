Web Components and the future of CSS
====================================

The slides and demos from my [SFHTML5 talk](http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/events/204366882/) on Nov. 24, 2014.

## Slides

To install the dependencies and view the slides, run the following commands:

```sh
# Install the dependencies.
npm install
bower install

# Start up a local server on port 3000.
npm start
```

You can now navigate in your browser to [localhost:3000/2014-11-24](http://localhost:3000/2014-11-24) and view the slides.

If you'd like to run the server on a different port, change the last command above to the following:

```sh
# Change "1234" to the port number of your choosing.
npm start -p 1234
```

## Demos

Once you have the server running, you can view the demos by navigating to [localhost:3000/2014-11-24/demos](http://localhost:3000/2014-11-24/demos).
